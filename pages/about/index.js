        all across the northeast. We believe in the importance of supporting
        local agriculture and promoting sustainable and humane farming
        practices, and are proud to partner with small family-owned farms that
        share our values and ethics.

      <h2>Our Farms</h2>
      <p>
        All of our cows are born and raised in Vermont, on small family-owned
        farms that have been passed down for generations. Our farmers are
        passionate about their work and take great pride in raising our cows to
        the highest standards. They are dedicated to providing our customers
        with the finest quality beef, and are committed to supporting their
        local community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our cows are raised in a natural and humane environment, where they have
        access to plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and are allowed to roam and
        graze on lush green pastures. This means that our beef is not only
        delicious and nutritious, but also raised with the utmost care and
        respect for the animals and the environment. The farmers take great care
        of their cows and are proud of the happy and healthy lives they provide
        for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that the quality of our products starts on the farm, which is
        why we work closely with our farmers to ensure that our cows are raised
        to the highest standards. We are grateful for their dedication and hard
        work, and are committed to supporting their efforts and the local
        farming community. We are proud to partner with these families and are
        honored to bring their delicious and nutritious beef to our customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope that our customers will appreciate the care and attention that
        goes into raising our cows, and will taste the difference in every bite
        of our delicious and nutritious beef. We are confident that our
        customers will be pleased with the quality of our products, and will
        come back for more.
